            <p>I interviewed and hired Patrick myself, close to four years ago, and would do it all over again if I could.</p>
<p>During his tenure at Lexop, he proved his dedication by implementing a number of best-practices, creating training material for the team, engaging in pair-programming and mentoring new hires and more junior developers.</p>
<p>He's also been instrumental in developing a number of our core components, and has done so in a way that makes them far simpler to maintain and build on. You can also clearly see how seriously he takes his work in the code reviews he leaves, and in hiring assessments he helped us complete throughout these last few years.</p>
<p>I highly recommend Patrick to anyone looking to hire a full-stack developer at the top of his game.</p>
